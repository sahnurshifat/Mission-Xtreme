                Next year you'll be able to retrace the fabled route of Marco Polo through Uzbekistan, from glitzy
                capital Tashkent to the sand-dusted city of Khiva in the west, all by high-speed rail. The extension of
                Uzbekistan's railways will put Khiva-whose 94 mosques and 63 madrasas make it a Unesco World Heritage.

            <p>
                There are career motivational phrases that say mistakes make you grow or never be afraid to fail.
                However, the idea of committing a mistake in the developer profession is not advisable. It is essential
                to learn from others experience to avoid costly errors that can make you be stuck with one job for too
                long.Perspective. It's relative. There's always someone bigger, better, faster, richer, better looking,
                etc! Such is life!
